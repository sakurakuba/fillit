42-Fillit
Algorithms Practice - Fit tetris pieces into the smallest square possible.

What Fillit Does:
Fillit recieves a map text file with pieces.
It finds the smallest possible square the pieces can be arranged in and prints out the square.

How does it work?
This project relies on the standard C Libary functions that we had to recode for our first project.
Compile via "make" command. Create valid and not valid file map with pieces and run with compiled binary program.
